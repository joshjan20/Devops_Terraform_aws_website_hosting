# Website Deployment to AWS using Terraform

This guide walks you through the steps to deploy a static website to an AWS S3 bucket using Terraform. The process includes configuring AWS credentials, creating an S3 bucket, and uploading the necessary files for the website.

## Prerequisites

- **AWS Account**: You need an active AWS account.
- **Terraform**: Ensure Terraform is installed on your local machine. You can download it from [Terraform Downloads](https://www.terraform.io/downloads).
- **AWS CLI**: If not installed, download from [AWS CLI Downloads](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/).

## Steps to Deploy

### Step 1: AWS Configuration

You need to configure AWS credentials using the AWS CLI or by exporting them directly.

1. **Using AWS CLI**:

   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

   - Enter your `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and default region.

2. **Or, export the values directly**:

   ```bash
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key-id"
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-access-key"
   ```

### Step 2: Terraform Setup

1. **Initialize Terraform**:

   Run the following commands to initialize the Terraform project:

   ```bash
   rm .terraform.lock.hcl
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   ```

2. **Apply the Terraform Configuration**:

   To create the infrastructure, apply the Terraform configuration:

   ```bash
   terraform apply -auto-approve
   ```

### Step 3: Terraform Files

#### `provide.tf`

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "5.10.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}
```

#### `main.tf`

This file defines resources to create the S3 bucket and upload website files.

```hcl
# Create S3 bucket
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "mybucket" {
  bucket = var.bucketname
}

# Set ownership controls
resource "aws_s3_bucket_ownership_controls" "example" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.mybucket.id
  rule {
    object_ownership = "BucketOwnerPreferred"
  }
}

# Configure public access block
resource "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" "example" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.mybucket.id
  block_public_acls       = false
  block_public_policy     = false
  ignore_public_acls      = false
  restrict_public_buckets = false
}

# Set bucket ACL to public-read
resource "aws_s3_bucket_acl" "example" {
  depends_on = [
    aws_s3_bucket_ownership_controls.example,
    aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block.example,
  ]

  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.mybucket.id
  acl    = "public-read"
}

# Upload index.html
resource "aws_s3_object" "index" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.mybucket.id
  key    = "index.html"
  source = "index.html"
  acl    = "public-read"
  content_type = "text/html"
}

# Upload JavaScript file
resource "aws_s3_object" "script" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.mybucket.id
  key    = "js/bootstrap.js"
  source = "js/bootstrap.js"
  acl    = "public-read"
  content_type = "application/javascript"
}

# Upload CSS file
resource "aws_s3_object" "style" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.mybucket.id
  key    = "css/style.css"
  source = "css/style.css"
  acl    = "public-read"
  content_type = "text/css"
}

# Configure the S3 bucket for website hosting
resource "aws_s3_bucket_website_configuration" "website" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.mybucket.id
  index_document {
    suffix = "index.html"
  }

  depends_on = [ aws_s3_bucket_acl.example ]
}
```

### Step 4: Upload Necessary Files

Ensure you have the following files ready to upload:

- `index.html`
- Any JavaScript and CSS files (e.g., `js/bootstrap.js`, `css/style.css`).
- Other assets like images, fonts, etc.

If you have more assets, make sure to add corresponding `aws_s3_object` resources in the `main.tf` file.

### Step 5: Access the Website

After running `terraform apply`, you can access your website at:

```
http://<your-bucket-name>.s3-website-<your-region>.amazonaws.com
```

Replace `<your-bucket-name>` and `<your-region>` with the actual values for your S3 bucket and AWS region.

This is a simplified guide to getting a static website deployed on AWS using Terraform. For more complex projects, you can further customize the Terraform configuration with additional resources, permissions, and domain configurations.
